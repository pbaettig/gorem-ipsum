- enable config through commandline parameter
- add prometheus instrumentation, test metrics (e.g. sine, random, e.g.)
- implement CI pipeline
- pack static assets into the binary, look at [packr](https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr/tree/master/v2)
- write JS frontend
- add benchmarks
- add integration / end-to-end tests
- add endpoints for sending HTTP requests to other services
- add parameters to specifiy service dependencies that are checked on startup, the HTTP endpoint of another service for example. The idea behind is to simulate a real world deployment or just to check the availability of other services.
